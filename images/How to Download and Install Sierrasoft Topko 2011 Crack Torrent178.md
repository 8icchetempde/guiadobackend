## How to Create a Digital Terrain Model
 
A digital terrain model (DTM) is a representation of the surface of the earth in a digital format. It consists of a grid of points with elevation values. You can create a DTM from various sources of data, such as GPS points, total station measurements, aerial photos, lidar scans, etc.
 
To create a DTM in Sierrasoft Topko 2011, follow these steps:

1. Open the software and create a new project. Give it a name and choose a coordinate system.
2. Import your data from the source file. You can use the Import Wizard to select the file format and the data type. You can also edit the data attributes, such as point codes, descriptions, colors, etc.
3. Go to the DTM menu and select Create DTM. Choose the points or the layers that you want to include in the DTM. You can also set the parameters for the DTM creation, such as interpolation method, grid size, breaklines, etc.
4. Click OK and wait for the DTM to be generated. You can view the DTM in 2D or 3D mode. You can also export the DTM to various formats, such as DXF, DWG, KML, CSV, etc.

## How to Create Contour Lines
 
Contour lines are lines that connect points of equal elevation on a map. They are useful for showing the shape and relief of the terrain. You can create contour lines from a DTM in Sierrasoft Topko 2011.
